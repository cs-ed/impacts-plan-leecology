# Impacts on Society
I currently work at a middle school with 7th and 8th grade students that is a title I school. The school is located in San Bernardino County, in Redlands Unified School District. Around 50% of the students Latinx students, around 30% White, 10% Asian, and 10% Black. A majority of the students are low income. The course that I am going to teach in the future is Animaker Space. This is a generalized STEAM electice class for 7th and 8th grade students made in partnership with Garner Holt Labs. The class is meant to introduce students to a variety of skills and tools, from Coding, 3d printing, CNC machines, animatronics, laser cutting, 3d modeling, and more. Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level This document will go over how we can address issues such as gender disparity stemming in computing fields, and 
Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level. Broadly explain how this document details how you plan to incorporate issues of computing impacts on society in your course

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

In this class, one of the goals will be to identify positive impacts that computing has had on society, and to try to identify future problems that could be potentially be solved using computing. 

Describe the learning objectives for the class that relate to social impacts. Consider using Bloom's Taxonomy to identify the types of cognitive and/or affective outcomes (and their associated verbs): https://bloomstaxonomy.net/

### Learning Activities

To address the learning object of positive impacts on society, the class will do a research report and presentation. The research will include students finding sources from reliable website, and using proper citation about their findings. The presentation will include a roughly 5 minute presentation in front of the class, using a format of their choice, such as Canva. This project would be one time, but would require around 1-2 weeks for completion. 

Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?

### Assessment

To assess the positive impact on society project, I would be checking the sources that they used, whether their topic was relevant, grammar and spelling, and looking at how they explained the future consequeses of their projected ideas. 

Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.

### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.
