# Impacts on Society
I currently work at a middle school with 7th and 8th grade students that is a title I school. The school is located in San Bernardino County, in Redlands Unified School District. My school last year had 1072 students. By race and rounded to closed %: there are 59% Hispanic, 18% White, 9% Asian, 6% African American, 3% Filipino, and 3% 2 or more races. By gender, there were 514 females students (48%) and 558 male students (52%). The course that I am going to teach in the future is Animaker Space. This is a generalized STEAM electice class for 7th and 8th grade students made in partnership with Garner Holt Labs. The class is meant to introduce students to a variety of skills and tools, from Coding, 3d printing, CNC machines, animatronics, laser cutting, 3d modeling, and more. Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level This document will go over how we can address issues such as gender and racial disparity stemming in computing fields, and addressing social impacting of computing. 


## Plan

### Learning Objectives

In this class, one of the goals will be to identify positive impacts that computing has had on society, and to try to identify future problems that could be potentially be solved using computing. They will compare and contrast positive and negative affects of current algorithms and computing on society. Students will also predict and explain areas where computing and algoriths could have potential impacts, and what those might look like. 

### Learning Activities

To address the learning object of positive impacts on society, the class will do a research report and presentation. The research will include students finding sources from reliable website, and using proper citation about their findings. The presentation will include a roughly 5 minute presentation in front of the class, using a format of their choice, such as Canva. This project would be one time, but would require around 1-2 weeks for completion. 

To address current impacts, they would participate in a reading and socratic seminar. They would read this article [https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing](url). 

The learning outcome for this assignment would be to analysis and address potential concerns for algorithms that have been broadly implemented. Students will be able to identify areas of concern, who is being affected, and ways to fix or improve it for the future. They would also need to address the positive and negative aspects of this algorithm. This activity would be initially an independent reading activity that would then be a socratic seminar in class. As the teacher I would bring up different aspects, and have students sit in the circle and discuss amongst each other their thoughts. This lessons would be geared for a high school level class, I think that especially with the racial component to it students would need to use poise and nuance in their discussion, which would be significantly harder at a lower level. 


### Assessment

To assess the positive impact on society project, I would be checking the sources that they used, whether their topic was relevant, grammar and spelling, and looking at how they explained the future consequeses of their projected ideas. 

For the socratic seminar, they would be graded on relevance, consequences, and future outlook. FOr relevance, did they actually read and undestand the article. For consequences, did they address and understand both positive and negative outcomes. For future outlook, did they understand ways that they could fix the algorithm and make it more accurate? 

### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.

Although all of my students are younger and would most likely have explosure and access to some technology, there is still a divide between what they have at home, their internet access, and their families' access to technology. In order to plan for this, I am hoping to start by being open about what computer science is and isn't, and how everyone can benefit from it. I also plan on giving out most of my assignments with a flexible timeline, such as assigned on Monday and due by Friday. This would be helpful not only for technological differences, but intellectual as well. Students who are diverse learners who need extra time would have flexibility on how and when they finish their work without being alienated by their peers or feel external time pressures. These programs also allow for IEP and SPED student accomodations. I am currently an inclusion science teacher at my school, and one of the most common ways that we adapt assignments for students is to reduce the volume of work without reducing the academic standards being covered. Both of the problet websites listed would allow for individualized changes and allow students with those IEP accomodations to have their academic needs met while still learning the same curriculum.

One of the ways that this class would help with broader participation is by simply getting all students exposed to it at an earlier age, but in a way that isn't tied to a gendered activity. In the history of computer science, it was marketed towards boys and men as a hobby, which has had negative impacts on women, both in general interest, but also collegiate majors and jobs. By creating the class that is centered around topics that are neutral, this would hopefully help to address it. The other way would be that in some of the assignments and projects for the class, students would have some freedom in the specific content that they are creating and submitting, which would allow them to focus on topics that give them genuine interest. Computing and computer science is not only male dominant, but is dispropotionatly represented by white males as seen in the statistics of college majors. By allowing students to choose topics as well, it would incentivie students across the racial spectrum as well to find topics that give them interest and enjoy computer science.
